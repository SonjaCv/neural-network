# neural-network

Implementation of a two layer neural network as part of a Machine learning course by Andrew Ng. I have implemented the calculation for cost function and gradient descent in the file nnCostFunction. The index file contains the steps from data loading to predicting labels to new data. I used this implementation for sentiment analysis of product reviews.
